# Unity VFX-Audio-Visualizer
##### By Sean McSweeney (D17125290)

## *Summary*
This project is going to explore the idea of using inputs from audio to manipulate the area around the camera. 
I am planning to have procedurally generated colourful areas with a moving camera. 
The area will move around you with the music depending on the decibels and other factors.
Instead of a generic visualizer tunnel I am planning to have random shapes appear around the camera.

## *Proposed Approach*
- [x] Research How to Implement Audio Listener
- [x] Set up Audio Listener to take in and recognise Audio
- [ ] Set up an camera that can be controlled by the user
- [ ] Add procedurally generated shapes around the camera within the FOV
