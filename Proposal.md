# Unity VFX-Audio-Visualizer
##### By Sean McSweeney (D17125290)

## *Summary*
This project is going to explore the idea of using inputs from audio to manipulate the area around the camera. 
I am planning to have procedurally generated colourful areas with a moving camera. 
The area will move around you with the music depending on the decibels and other factors.
Instead of a generic visualizer tunnel I am planning to have random shapes appear around the camera inside the tunnel.
I also want the user to be able to control the camera and for the tunnel to be created in the direction of the camera.
I am planning to make my own Music and Assets for this assignment and I am going to take a retro nintendo art style (Wind Waker/ Ocarina of Time). 
I love this art style as it is timeless and due to the cartoon art style the games are still highly playable even today. 
I want to utilize Perlin noise to allow for a cool inner tunnel terrain that is completely random and I want each object in the scene to have a random mesh renderer material. 

## *Technical Requirements*
- One VR headset
- PC
- Unity -

## *Proposed Approach*
- [x] Research Procedural Generation
- [x] Research How to Implement Audio Listener
- [ ] Set up Audio Listener to take in and recognise Audio
- [ ] Set up an camera that can be controlled by the user
- [ ] Add procedurally generated tunnel that builds with the camera direction
- [ ] Add procedurally generated shapes around the camera within the FOV
- [ ] Utilise Perlin Noise in the Procedural Tunnel
- [ ] Create a randomly generated color script for materials
