## *Summary*
The *Unity VFX-Audio-Visualizer* manipulates audio frequencies to make an impressive and enjoyable environment. For each time the Scalar reaches above the set Upper and Lower Scalars a shape is created. That shape is given a random position which is a certain distance below and above the user. The distance is between 30 and -30 vertical and horizontal. The shape is randomly generated and the colour is also randomly generated. There is a frequency ring and a frequency visualizer which both are manipulated by the incoming audio. Oculus Integration is also used and movement for the user is disabled. The user will be able to see their hands in VR to further immerse the experience. The tunnel created is also linked to the oculus headset so that when the user looks either direction the walls will appear to stretch.
 
 ## *Conclusion*
I am very happy with the outcome of this project it is very customisable and it can be used with any song. It is also built for VR which enhances the user experience.
